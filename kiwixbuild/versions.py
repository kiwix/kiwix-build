# - Values are integer or None
# - If a project is not in the dict (or None), the project is not released.
# - If release_versions[project] == 0, this is the first time the project is
#   build for this release, so publish src and build archives.
# - If release_versions[project] > 0, release only the build archive with a
#   build postfix.
# To change this dictionnary, use the following algorithm:
# - If project version change, set release_versions[project] = 0
# - Else
#    - If project depedencies have not change, set it to None and update the
#     `(was ...)`.
#    - Else, increment the value. If no value was present, see `(was ...)`.

# For kiwix-desktop, if this is not None:
# - set KIWIX_DESKTOP_RELEASE to 1
# - set KIWIX_DESKTOP_VERSION to the version of the release (including release_versions)
# If this is None:
# - set KIWIX_DESKTOP_RELEASE to 0
